# story-collection-portal
This will be a portal that manages user-submitted media (images, videos, text, other types of documents).  I will allow the user to upload files from their own devices as well as uploading from Google Drive.

The project was started because a school had a need to manage all the parent-submitted materials that the school can catalog for marketing and historical purposes.  I am hoping it can be useful to any number of organizations that have a similar need.

The project is based on .NET 5.0 usign Razor Pages and Web API.  There will be plenty of client-side code to manage the frontend experience, which is important.

The frontend has two parts -- one for users to upload materials and another for admin users to catalog and otherwise manage the materials.  
The backend API handles recording of the transactions.
